The riWeb module for RingoJS.
=================================================

This module provides access to your Multivalue Database application through
a standard HTTP formatted call. This allow you to retrieve data and process
business logic that is already built into your system, and output the results
in any manner of format.

This module requires the RingoJS package. This package is available from
ringojs.org.


Currently supported Multivalue Databases:
==================================================
  D3 by TigerLogic
  Universe by Rocket Software
  OpenQM by Ladybridge Systems

  This software is released under the Apache License. It is available free
of charge and as is without any warranty.


Usage
=================================================

 To get started you will need to first download and install RingoJS from 
http://www.ringojs.org. (This is really easy. The folks at ringojs are amazing). 
The whole thing will require Java to run so make sure that is available.

 Once RingoJS is installed download all of the source code and copy the "rdm"
folder into the ringo modules directory. The main application is the riWeb 
folder and that can be placed anywhere you would like.

To launch the web server, issue the command:

  ringo PATH_TO_/riWeb/main.js  
(replace PATH_TO_ with the path that the riWeb folder was place in)

This will launch an instance of the jetty web server that is already built into
ringojs.

From here if you wish to pass data to your Multivalue application you
must copy the 3 programs in the MVCode folder into your Multivalue database.

1. RDM.GET.DATA
2. RDM.SEND.DATA
3. SWAP (If you already have a subroutine called swap you may need to rename this).
