The riWeb module for RingoJS.
=================================================

This module provides access to your Multivalue Database application through
a standard HTTP formated call. This allow you to retrieve data and process
business logic that is already built into your system, and out put the results
in any manner of format.
 
This module requires the RingoJS package. This package is avalible from 
ringojs.org. 

 
Currently supported Multivalue Databases:
==================================================
  D3 by TigerLogic
  Universe by Rocket Software
  OpenQM by Ladybridge Systems


License
=================================================

  This software is released under the Apache License. It is avalable free
of charge and as is without any warranty.


Usage
=================================================

  The software is pretty simple to use. First download the source code from
http://www.rdminfinity.com/multivalue. You will also need to download and 
install RingoJS from http://www.ringojs.org. (This is really easy. The folks
at ringojs are amazing). The whole thing requires Java to run so make sure
that is avalible.

 Once RingoJS is installed copy the "rdm" folder into the ringo modules
folder. The main application is the riWeb folder. This can e placed 
anywhere you would like.

To launch the web server you issue the command:

  ringo PATH_TO_riWeb/main.js

This will launch an instance of the jetty webserver that is built into 
ringojs.

From here if you wish to pass data to your Multivalue application you 
must copy the 3 programs in the MVCode folder into your Multivalue database.

1. RDM.GET.DATA
2. RDM.SEND.DATA
3. SWAP (If you already have a subroutine called swap you may need to rename this).
